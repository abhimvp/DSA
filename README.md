## Reference 

- When DSA problems felt hard for me to solve, I put all my attention on the basics and pattern-based learning.

For different types of input, I broke things down by patterns:
Arrays/Strings:
► Sliding Window
► Two Pointers
► Prefix Sum
► Hashing
► Sorting & Binary Search

Linked Lists:
► Fast & Slow Pointer
► Reversal Patterns
► Merge Intervals

Trees/Graphs:
► DFS/BFS
► Topological Sort
► Lowest Common Ancestor
► Union Find/Disjoint Set
► Backtracking

Dynamic Programming:
► 0/1 Knapsack
► Longest Increasing Subsequence
► Matrix DP
► State Compression
► Coin Change Patterns

For each pattern, I picked 2–3 classic problems and solved them until the logic clicked.

When learning system design felt overwhelming,
I focused on applying fundamentals by solving practical design problems.

For fundamentals like:
 Scalability: Design a URL shortener
 Consistency: Design a distributed cache
 Reliability: Design a message queue
 API Design: Design a RESTful service
 Data Modeling: Design a relational schema for e-commerce

Every concept became clear when I saw it in action, not just in theory.
When learning how to grow as a software engineer felt tough,
I put all my focus on these 5 fundamentals:

1. Mastering communication (written & verbal)
2. Breaking down problems before jumping to code
3. Reading and understanding code written by others
4. Consistently asking for feedback and acting on it
5. Building for impact, not just for completion

All through my career, whenever things got tough, going back to the basics, whether in DSA, system design, or growth, has always served me best.

If you’re stuck, start with the fundamentals. It works.
